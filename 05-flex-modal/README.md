# Flexbox Exercise: A Common Modal Style

This exercise replicates a typical modal window layout using **Flexbox**.

## 🧾 Objective

Recreate the layout of a common modal dialog that contains:
- A blue icon aligned to the left
- A header section with a close (✕) button on the top-right
- Main content text aligned with the header
- Cancel and Continue buttons at the bottom

## ✅ Requirements (Self Check)

- The blue icon is aligned to the left.
- Equal spacing exists on both sides of the icon.
- There is `padding` around all edges of the modal.
- Header, text, and buttons are aligned with each other.
- The header is bold and has slightly larger text.
- The close button is aligned to the top-right and vertically centered with the header.
- Modal layout is created using **Flexbox only** (no positioning or floats).

## 📁 Files

- `index.html`
- `style.css`

## 📌 Notes

- You may need to restructure the HTML to add wrapper containers.
- `flex-shrink` might be useful to prevent the icon from collapsing.
- Try to keep your CSS flexible and responsive where possible.

## 🚀 How to Use

Open the `index.html` file in your browser to view the modal layout.
