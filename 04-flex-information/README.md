# 04-flex-information

This exercise implements a very common layout pattern found on many informational websites.

## ✅ Goals

- Horizontally center a set of items below a centered title.
- Use Flexbox to arrange the items and control spacing.
- Wrap long text inside fixed-width boxes.
- Structure the HTML with appropriate containers to support the flex layout.

## 🛠️ What was used

- CSS Flexbox (`display: flex`, `justify-content`, `align-items`, `gap`)
- Fixed widths (`width: 200px`) and text alignment (`text-align: center`)
- Spacing (`gap`, `margin`, `padding`) to meet layout specs

## 📐 Layout requirements

- Title centered horizontally
- 32px space between the title and the items
- 52px space between items
- Items 200px wide, text wraps and is centered

## 💡 Notes

No floats, no absolute positioning — only modern flexbox techniques.
